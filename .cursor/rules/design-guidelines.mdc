# Design Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Minimalism
- Embrace whitespace as a design element
- Include only what is absolutely necessary
- Remove all decorative elements that don't serve a functional purpose
- When in doubt, remove rather than add
- **CRITICAL**: Never add explanatory text boxes, hints, or guidance elements unless explicitly requested

### Premium Aesthetics
- Use high contrast elements (black on white, white on black)
- Employ clean typography with proper spacing
- Prefer rounded shapes for interactive elements
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- **CRITICAL**: Font weight must be light (font-light) for headings, never bold unless specified

### Inspiration
- Follow design patterns from premium products like Notion and Spotify
- Prioritize clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Use subtle animations and transitions
- Avoid flashy or game-like elements

## UI Components

### Buttons
- Use rounded buttons (rounded-full for primary actions)
- Keep button text concise and action-oriented
- ALl buttons should have cursor-pointer.
- Implement subtle hover states (opacity changes preferred)
- Include proper focus states for accessibility
- Avoid excessive shadows or 3D effects

### Typography
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font
- Maintain a clear hierarchy with limited font sizes
- **CRITICAL**: Always use lighter font weights (font-light) for larger text and headings
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
- Never use bold fonts for headings unless explicitly requested

### Colors
- Primary Palette: Use black, white, and shades of gray as the foundation. Use color purposefullyâ€”for highlights, interactions, feedback, and visual hierarchy. Any additional color should feel cohesive with the minimal, dark aesthetic of the app.
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Implement proper dark mode inversions
- **CRITICAL**: Never add colored information boxes or colored backgrounds for sections

### Layout
- Center important actions
- Use a clean grid system
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Allow for proper breathing room around elements
- **CRITICAL**: Avoid nested containers or unnecessary grouping divs

## Interaction Design

### Feedback
- Provide subtle visual feedback on interaction
- Use opacity or slight color changes for hover states
- Implement smooth, subtle transitions
- Avoid flashy animations or effects

### Accessibility
- Include proper focus indicators
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make interactive elements appropriately sized
- Support keyboard navigation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Following Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Implement ONLY what is explicitly requested by the user
- Never add "helpful" UI elements that weren't requested
- When in doubt about a feature, ask rather than implement
- Do not add explanatory text, tooltips, or guidance unless specifically requested

### What to Avoid

#### Excessive Elements
- Multiple containers or nested boxes
- Decorative icons or graphics that don't serve a purpose
- Headers or text that isn't absolutely necessary
- Borders or dividers unless needed for clarity
- **CRITICAL**: Explanatory boxes, hints, or guidance text that wasn't requested

#### Visual Noise
- Gradients or complex backgrounds
- Multiple colors or color variations
- Shadows or 3D effects
- Animations that distract rather than guide
- **CRITICAL**: Colored backgrounds for content sections

#### Complexity
- Nested or complex layouts
- Multiple interactive elements when one would suffice
- Unnecessary information or options
- Anything that distracts from the primary action
- **CRITICAL**: Never add "helpful" UI elements that weren't explicitly requested
